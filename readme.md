### Summary
The BFRTableReorder is an out of the box solution to add long press reordering to your [ASDK](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit) apps üéâ! It started off as an Objective-C port of the excellent [Swift Reorder](https://github.com/adamshin/SwiftReorder/) by Adam Shin, but we ended up hacking it apart for ASDK purposes.

We use it all over the place in [Buffer for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buffer-for-twitter-pinterest/id490474324?mt=8) :-).

### Installation
The BFRTableReorder is hosted on CocoaPods and is the recommended way to install it:
```ruby
pod 'BFRTableReorder'
```


### Quickstart
To kick things off, you need to include one header file anywhere you want some reordering action to happen üòä:
```objc
#import "ASTableNode+BFRReorder.h"
```

This will add the `reorder` property to any table node instance via a category. To get up and running quickly with BFRTableReorder, just set your controller as the delegate off of any `ASTableNode`'s `reorder` property:
```objc
self.tableNode.reorder.delegate = self;
```

From there, you're only required to implement one delegate method, but there are several optional ones that can help out as well:
```objc
- (void)tableNode:(ASTableNode *)tableNode redorderRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)fromIndexPath toIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)toIndexPath;
```

There is a very simple example in the demo project, feel free to fire it up if you want to see all the delegate methods in action üíØ.

### Going Forward
We regularly maintain this code, and you can also rest assured that it's been battle tested against thousands of users in production üëç. That said, we get things wrong from time to time - so feel free to open an issue for anything you spot!
